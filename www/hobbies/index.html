						Roots

					<p>
						I've been playing guitar since I was 11 and drums since I was 15. Music has always been a pretty big part
						of my life and I've been in several bands in my life. I've shifted genres over time from metal and punk over
						towards the alternative and indie side. The first band I was ever in played "That's What You Get" by Paramore
						at our high school talent show and we surprisingly won! It was my first time playing drums live. I wish I had
						a video of it... But I've played in several bands since then, and I just love playing drums on stage.

						Recently

					<p>
						Ever since college started for me, I haven't been able to play as much as I'd like to. I had to quit my bands
						and focus on school. That's okay with me though because every time I visit my parents, I go to the basement and
						jam out on the drums for a bit to satiate my constant urge to whack shit with wooden sticks in a sporatic, yet
						structured and controlled manner. I did, however, get the chance to write and record a song for one of my english
						classes. We were instructed to come up with a creative project related to language, so I wrote a song about how
						speaking up has always been tough for me and how I learned to overcome that. Warning: the audio quality is 
						~terrible~ because I didn't have access to a real drum kit or guitar amp and I also wrote and recorded the whole
						thing in a 12 hour one-nighter the day before it was due.

						Although I've never been a good guitarist, I used to ask my band members if I could play a quick acoustic
						tune in the middle of our set. It was almost always a joke song I wrote when I was 16 called "Morning Wood"
						(That's what I was playing in the photo to the left). When I wasn't on stage, I was in a makeshift recording
						studio in my parent's basement, writing and recording songs. I actually got pretty good at using $10 microphones
						and <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">open source recording software</a> to record songs with semi-decent
						recording quality. Here's a song I wrote my senior year of high school:

						I've been playing baseball since before I can even remember. It is quite literally my favorite past-time.
						I played on rec leagues every summer until high school when I played on my freshman and sophomore teams.
						I stopped playing for my high school after that to pursue music, but I still played pickup games with my
						friends as much as I possibly could. At Loyola, I joined the club baseball team and played left field and
						third base for the two years I played there. I plan to continue playing pickup games and hitting up batting
						cages as much as I possibly can for as long as I possibly can.

						These images show a triple I hit during a game against DePaul in Spring 2019. I'm not usually one to brag,
						but since I am usually a ~terrible~ baseball player, this was by far the highlight of my baseball career.

					Rubik's Cubes
				</h1>
				<p>
					When I was a child, my sister was a special olympics swimmer. My dad and I would always go to her swim meets
					to watch her swim. As you may or may not know, swim meets take ~forever~, so my dad and I would always bring
					activities and snacks for us to do while waiting for her races to begin. We always brought a Rubik's cube with
					us and try to solve it. One day, we eventually finished it. We solved the Rubiks's cube in a hot, chlorine filled
					pool room at Stagg High School. Ever since that day, I've been absolutely obsessed with the idea of solving a
					Rubik's cube as fast as I can. So far, my fastest time is 12.88 seconds. On average, I'm usually around 20-25 
					seconds, but that one time, I got lucky with an OLL and PLL skip. Since I've sorta plateaued with a 3x3 cube,
					I expanded to 4x4s, 5x5s, etc. I once got my hands on a 7x7 cube and it took me a little over an hour to solve.
					In high school, I played with them so much that it pissed off my parents and teachers. I kept skipping my homework
					assignments and refusing to study because I was so obsessed. Nowadays, I rarely find time to play with them, but if
					I ever need a mental break from school, coding, or work, I'll pick up a cube and solve it as many times as I can in
					a 15 minute block.

					Arch Linux
				</h1>
				<p>
					If you've ever tried to install Arch Linux, you know that it is crazy hard. Like it took me forever to figure it out.
					I love the fact that it took forever. It's a puzzle. In my Sophomore year of college, I decided to delve into the
					world of Linux. After a week or so of research, I could install Ubuntu and Mint on my own. It's a shallow learning 
					curve, but it was a good way for me to dip my toes in. I got a little too ambitious after that first week and decided
					to jump right into Arch Linux. 'Twas a poor decision. I very quickly learned how little I know. No GUI?!?! What am
					I a neanderthal? I stuck with Ubuntu for a bit. I took a Summer to learn Bash and what each directory in the root
					filesystem of Linux means. Come my Jeanior year (junior/senior since I graduated a year early), I decided to revisit
					Arch Linux. I tried ~so~ many times. Like hundreds. "What the fuck is an fstab?" "What the hell is a chroot?" "How the 
					FUCK do I connect to the internet?" This was a tough puzzle to crack. Yes, I know, I know, the Arch Wiki has
					literally everything you need to know. But when you're a noob like I was, the Arch Wiki is written in heiroglyphics.
					Eventually, I finally got it installed. At least to the point that I could boot into the tty1 terminal. No desktop
					manager yet. Now, at this time, I knew of the race war that exists between GNOME and KDE users. Since I'd been using
					GNOME on Ubuntu for a few months, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try KDE Plasma. My apologies to the GNOME fanboys, but
					Plasma is fuckin awesome. Anywhomst, the installation process of Arch Linux was such a fun process of puzzles.
					I still run Arch on all my machines to this day (except for the Raspberry Pi upon which this webserver is deployed).

					Coding!
				</h1>
				<p>
					Of course I had to plug my love for coding under the puzzles hobby. I mean, I literally wrote a program with a couple
					other developers to <a href="/projects/#puzzle_solver">automate a puzzle solving process</a>.
					Come on, solving coding problems and tracking bugs is such a terrible, atrocious, beautiful, wonderfully satisfying
					process. I, much like many other programmers, have a love/hate relationship with solving coding problems. It's hell.
					It is quite literally hell. But it's my hell. A hell that I can conquer and understand given enough effort and
					dedication. I could talk about coding for a couple paragraphs, but you're already on this website, so you get the point.

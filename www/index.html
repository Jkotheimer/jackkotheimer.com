				<h1>
					Who am I?
				</h1>
				<p>
					I am an engineer located in Chicago, Illinois. I have a B.S. in software engineering,
					and I am currently attending UIC for a M.S in electrical engineering. I decided to
					make this site and host it from a Raspberry Pi in my apartment as a fun little project
					to keep me occupied while my classes obliterated my sanity! Since then, I've migrated
					the site to Amazon Web Services.

			<div class="panel">
				<h1>
					Where am I now?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Well, I'm most likely at a desk, teaching myself some random skill out of absolute boredome.
					In a more worldly sense, I am trying to put myself through graduate school, which means ya boy
					needs some experience. I'm ready for any part-time opportunities as a sofware developer (which
					is where my strengths lie currently). I'll make you the niftiest server-side solutions south of Santa.
					That may be an overstatement, but my proudest skills are: happily hacking away at problems 'till they're solved,
					caring too much, and snacking perpetually.

				<h1>
					Where do I want to be?
				</h1>
				<p>
					This question is rigged because the answer changes every month. Right now, I want to be and embedded systems engineer, 
					mixing that software and hardware knowledge. That's the dream, ya know? Like after this graduate degree and several internships.
					The focus of my undergrad was backend web service programming. Like designing and writing REST api's and SaaS/PaaS systems. I'll use that to
					keep myself employed through grad school until I'm qualified for a position as an electrical engineer.

				<h1>
					Who am I?
				</h1>
				<p>
					I am an engineer located in Chicago, Illinois and I'm <span id='jacks_age'></span> years old. 
					You could describe me as a punk-nerd. I have a B.S. in software engineering and I'm in love
					with all things STEM, but you'll find me playing drums along to Blink-182 songs and skateboarding
					around the suburbs on my free time.

				<h1>
					What am I up to now?
				</h1>
				<p>
					I am currently a full-stack developer at <a href='https://www.ezclinic.co/' target='_blank'>EzClinic&trade;</a>.
					They've been having me do all sorts of fun stuff over there. Most notably, writing remote deployment automation scripts,
					restructuring the tech stack of their web server and database, and refactoring their web app down to a REST api
					to decouple the server-side code from the client. +10 points for you if you understood any of that! Along with that,
					I have been pursuing hobbies and other career goals in my free time.

				<h1>
					Where do I want to be?
				</h1>
				<p>
					The long term goal is to become an embedded systems engineer. I love audio and signal processing systems, so I'd love to
					develop embedded devices that deal with such things. This obviously means I need a degree in E.E., which I
					will feel comfortable pursuing when universities are safe to return to in-person classes.

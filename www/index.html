				HELLO, I'M<br/>

				<h1>
					Introduction Time!
				</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Jack Kotheimer (as if that isn't obvious already), and I will be graduating 
					from Loyola University with a B.S. in software engineering in May 2020. I decided to
					make this site and host it from a Raspberry Pi in my apartment as a fun little project
					to keep me occupied while my classes obliterated my sanity!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="panel">
				<h1>
					Where am I now?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Well, I'm most likely currently at a desk somewhere, busting my butt for the greater good 
					of humanity (or the greater good of my GPA). But in a more worldly sense, I am attending
					Loyola University, currently enrolled in 18 credit hours. I just finished up a rather ravaging
					semester of 21 credit hours of pure Computer Science courses last fall.
					Don't believe me? Here's a screenshot of my official schedule:
					<br/>
					<span class="toggle_button" onclick=toggle_view(document.getElementById("schedule"))>
						Click to toggle insane schedule view
					</span>
					<img src="/images/Fall_19_Schedule.png" id="schedule" class="toggle_img"/>
					<br/><br/>
					Insane, right?
					<br/>
					How'd I do?
					<br/>
					<span class="toggle_button" onclick=toggle_view(document.getElementById("grades"))>
						Click to toggle mediocre results
					</span>
					<img src="/images/Fall_19_grades.png" id="grades" class="toggle_img"/>
					<br/><br/>
					When I'm not drowning in school work or tinkering with tech, you can either find me in 
					the gym, on a baseball field, playing music, or eating copious amounts of food.

				<h1>
					Where do I want to be?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Ah yes, the 'goals' panel. 
					<span style="color:orange;">"What could this imbecile possibly want to do with his life? His non-professional
					tone and goofy persona can't possibly get him anywhere in this strict world of business."</span>
					Well, random human, I can assure you I have goals; quite ambitious ones at that. Once I get
					my nice shiny piece of paper that proves I have a brain stem, I want to build software systems for a company
					that aligns with my morals. <span style="color:orange;">"So... just a dev job?"</span>. 
					Well I'm not done - I'm a really good project manager. If you take a look at my projects tab,
					for each project labelled 'team project', I wrote a management scheme for all of them - 
					<span style="color:lightblue;">"You do this, you do that, I'll take care of this, and we should 
					be done by next week"</span> - hasn't failed me yet.
					<br/><br/>
					Ooooohhh, you meant location wise? Well I currently live in Chicago, but once I
					get my $100,000 sheet of paper in May, I'm willing to chuck myself anywhere in the world.
					<span style="color:orange;">"Anywhere?"</span> Yes, anywhere on the entire planet (if anyone
					wants to send me somewhere off this planet, I'm in - where do I sign?).

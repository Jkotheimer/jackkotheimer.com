				HELLO, I'M<br/>

				<h1>
					Introduction Time!
				</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Jack Kotheimer (as if that isn't obvious already), and I graduated
					from Loyola University with a B.S. in software engineering in May 2020. I decided to
					make this site and host it from a Raspberry Pi in my apartment as a fun little project
					to keep me occupied while my classes obliterated my sanity! Since then, I've migrated
					the site to Amazon Web Services.
				</p>

			<div class="panel">
				<h1>
					Where am I now?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Well, I'm most likely at a desk, teaching myself some random skill out of absolute boredome.
					Likely candidates are: solving Rubik's cubes, playing drums/guitar, coding one of my many side
					projects, or tinkering around with some electronics project. But in a more worldly sense, I
					am on the hunt for a job! If you happen to be hiring or know somebody who is hiring, I recommend
					you skim through my life (the whole thing is on this site). My skills include silently working at
					a desk until my task is complete, caring too much, and eating copious amounts of food.

				<h1>
					Where do I want to be?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Ah yes, the 'goals' panel. 
					<span style="color:orange;">"What could this imbecile possibly want to do with his life? His non-professional
					tone and childish personality can't possibly get him anywhere in this strict world of business."</span>
					Well, random human, I can assure you I have goals; quite ambitious ones at that. I recently recieved 
					a nice shiny piece of paper that proves I have a brain stem, so now I want to build software systems for a company
					that aligns with my morals. <span style="color:orange;">"So... just a dev job?"</span>. 
					Well I'm not done - I'm a really good project manager. If you take a look at my projects tab,
					for each project labelled 'team project', I wrote a management scheme - 
					<span style="color:lightblue;">"You do this, you do that, I'll take care of this, and we should 
					be done by next week"</span> - hasn't failed me yet.
					<br/><br/>
					Ooooohhh, you meant location wise? Well I currently live in Chicago, but I'm willing to chuck myself anywhere in the world.
					<span style="color:orange;">"Anywhere?"</span> Yes, anywhere on the entire planet (if anyone
					would like to send me somewhere off this planet, I'm in - where do I sign?).

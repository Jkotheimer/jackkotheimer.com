					Description
				</h1>
				<p>
					Pianoboard is a personal full stack web development project.
					The front end is purely written in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. The back end runs on an Apache web server
					using a PHP/MySQL instance for all CRUD operations. The middleware REST API is implemented in
					Java using Apache CXF running on a Tomcat servlet. This servlet runs on a separate port from the Apache
					web server, and is therefore proxied to under the /api directory. The REST API is to be reimplemented in 
					Node.js or some other runner up tool to simplify the codebase and compare performance. Java middleware
					can often be over-engineered, so I'd like to see if using a different tool opens the possibility for a
					more readable and maintainablle codebase.

					ERD Explained

				<p>
					Above is a nice little Entity Relationship Diagram of the Pianoboard SQL database. I tried to keep it as simple
					as possible. User accounts are of course the focal point. Users have a list of favorite genres and favorite
					artists (I may add more detailed preferences and 'likes' later). Each account is tied to a list of known IP
					addresses and IP addresses that have tried and failed to login. This is obviously used for security in the middleware.
					Accounts also have tokens tied to them, used for authentication. And lastly, each user account has a list of
					zero or more projects. Each project has a list of tracks, upon which there is a list of recordings, within which
					there is a list of notes. Each of those entities has an ID along with a creation datae and last modified date.
					There is a separate table that lists the permissions any one account may have to an entity that does not belong
					to them. For instance, if user 123 made a recording that they want to share with their friend, they could do so,
					and their friend's account ID would show up in the AccessRights table along with the recording ID, giving them
					read or write permissions.

					Description
				</h1>
				<p>
					This project was completed for a database programming course. The goal was to create any type of application that
					has heavy I/O to the database. The four of us quickly decided on making a chat application. Our model narrative
					was to make the application for customer service. If a customer has a question, they can select the topic they have
					a question about, which then creates a chat request, which can be accepted by a single customer service representative.
					Once in the chat session, both parties can send and recieve messages on the fly. Once finished, the service rep marks the
					session as resolved and the messages become archived.

				<p>
					Shown above is an Entity Relationship Diagram depicting the database model of the chat app. The bullet points cover the
					general idea of what each relationship represents. At a programmatic level, the relationships are fairly straightforward
					as explained earlier. Obviously, in a real scenario, the service representative and customer account login flow would
					occur on different secure servers, but for the purposes of the project, keeping them local worked just fine.

					Description
				</h1>
				<p>
					This project was a little lighter on the UI than Pianoboard. It was my first server-side development project,
					so the focus was on server logic. Mohammed, Jack, and I built a simple E-commerce REST API service written in
					Java, using Apache CXF running on a Tomcat servlet (déjà vu much?). For about a month in December 2019, we
					deployed the .war file on AWS ECS along with the basic client files. It of course was not secure by any means 
					(no ssl certificate and no actual payment methods), but it had the general gist of an E-commerce site.
					You've got buyer accounts and seller accounts. Sellers post items, Buyers search for them and buy them
					(metaphorically).

				<p>
					Shown is another Entity Relationship Diagram. This one outlines the general premise behind the E-commerse
					website. This was never actually implemented into a SQL database, but the relationships held for the actual
					data storage mechanism that was used. Embarrassing as it is to say, that storage mechanism happened to just
					be POJOs stored in RAM. Oof, that one doesn't look good on us but hey, it was our first web service and the
					point was to learn how REST API works. And we did! Anywhomst, The premise of the ERD is fairly straight forward.
					As stated above, there are buyer accounts and seller accounts. Buyers can place orders. The OrderedItems
					relationship links orders with multiple different products of a specified quantity. Products are posted by 
					sellers. Both buyers and sellers have addresses and payment infos. Payment infos also have a billing address
					ID attribute. Pretty basic, but it's what got me started on this path of being a full stack web dev!

				<p>
					Above is the research result poster for TalkMotion. This was presented at Loyola University Chicago's
					Summer 2019 research program banquet. This application was meant to be a proof of concept for a research
					project originally contrived by

					Hannah Thompson</a>, a rather splendid graduate student who suffers from cerebral palsy. He noticed how
					difficult her DynaVox was to work with, and figured a gesture-based device would be easier for people with
					similar conditions to communicate with. More information about that experience can be found under the
					<a href="/work_experience/" style="text-decoration:underline">work_experience</a> tab.
					The application we ended up designing utilized the accelerometer inside an Android device and had a 6 different
					hand motions preset with the app. Each motion can be assigned to a word, and we used a text to speech API
					to have the phone speak each command.

					Description
				</h1>
				<p>
					Our challenge was to solve the puzzle to the left. But not just that specific puzzle. Any word logic puzzle.
					The process had to be entirely automated, but we could format the input of the puzzle any way we wanted
					without giving away any hints (basically make it such that we didn't have to worry about natural language processing).
					Simple enough... json! We structured the input data in a json file such that the first entity is the list
					of objects being referred to, the next three are the objects being solved for, and the rest are clues.
					Here is an example of what the JSON file looked like for the Mixed up Purses problem:<br/>
					{<br/>
					&emsp;"people" : ["Paula", "Pat", "Pam", "Penny", "Peggy"],<br/>
					&emsp;"lost" : ["lipstick", "comb", "compact", "file", "keyring"],<br/>
					&emsp;"lastname" : ["Jones", "Smith", "Johnson", "Doe", "Dixon"],<br/>
					&emsp;"job" : [ "doctor", "lawyer", "judge", "teacher", "pilot"],<br/>
					&emsp;"clue1" : {"job" : "pilot", ... <br/>
					}<br/>
					There's not much front end to this project, but the highlights in my opinion are the data structures we created
					to make the logic work as smoothly as it does, and the project management.

				<h1>
					A Look at the Code
				</h1>
				<p>
					There are only 4 main project files. One of which is the main function, the rest of which are custom data
					structures to hold the arbitrary puzzle information. One is a reference map, one is a clue map, and the other
					is a puzzle solver class to blend the two together. The clue map is essentially an iterator, and the reference map
					is a hash map, but with an auto-eliminate method to read through itself and eliminate invalid attributes.
					The main method grinds the two together with the puzzle solver class until the puzzle is solved. Unit tests
					are of course implemented to cover almost every method in every class, and they all pass for several different
					word logic puzzle inputs.

				<h1>
					Project Management
				</h1>
				<p>
					This project was completed as a midterm for COMP 330 - Software Engineering. The premise of the class was not only
					to create a working software system, but to manage a team properly. Our team ran like a hot knife through butter.
					Not everybody was familiar with Git version controlling, so we all met up at the library together and gathered
					around a laptop. I have rather quick hands, so I coded the ideas as they spilled out of my colleagues mouths.
					It truly was a hell of a situation to be a part of. Very cliché college study session with the whiteboard full
					of heiroglyphics and people pacing back and forth in a small conference room 90% of the project was done in a day.
					After that, I assigned each person a task: Bug report, Requirements completion report, unit tests, and code cleansing/
					documentation. Needless to say, we got a damn good grade.
